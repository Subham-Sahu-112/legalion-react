                    Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) refers to a set of
                    processes used to settle disputes outside the courtroom. It
                    provides a less adversarial, more collaborative approach,
                    allowing parties to reach mutually agreeable outcomes with
                    the help of neutral third parties.

                      A neutral mediator helps both parties communicate,
                      understand each other‚Äôs positions, and work toward a

                      A private and more flexible alternative to court, where an

                      decision, which can be binding or non-binding based on

                      Similar to mediation, but the conciliator may take a more
